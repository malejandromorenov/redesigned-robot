# Redesigned Robot

Based in the cloud on Google, I'm test the solution in the dashboard, i have a one machine with Linux Ubuntu and one container on Kubernetes.
First time a probe with Apache Local and hold up web pages or open port for next services.

```cmd
sudo apt-get install apache2
sudo apt-get install http
```
Over other instance of time
Install Drive in shell linux
```cmd
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:twodopeshaggy/drive
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install drive
```
Also run
```cmd
sudo apt install zypper
```
Add repos in the terminal
```cmd
zypper ar http://download.videolan.org/pub/vlc/SuSE/11.1 vlc # Not functional
zypper ar  http://my.web.server.repository/suse/11.3 local_web # Not functional  
zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/distribution/11.4/repo/oss/ oss

https://nu.novell.com/repo/$RCE/SLES11-SP4-Pool/sle-11-x86_64 SLES
```

Clean the trash, if will your mind, delete something and start the new carrer. Open-SUSE was stable since now am trying in Ubuntu.
